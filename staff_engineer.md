title: Staff Engineer
---

As a Staff Engineer you lead through technical expertise, cross-team collaboration, and technical influence. You shape architectural direction and mentor others helping teams deliver scalable solutions.

## Impact

- Step into teams as a “traveling craftsman” to provide focused technical support, whether by accelerating delivery, addressing deep technical challenges, or mentoring team members. Transition out once the team is unblocked and empowered.
- Leave behind clear, valuable artifacts such as documentation, diagrams, utilities, or design patterns that continue to support the team after you’ve moved on.
- Identify patterns and common needs across multiple teams, and proactively create scalable tools, frameworks, or guidance that help solve shared problems efficiently.
- Set and drive engineering standards that elevate code quality, reliability, and maintainability across systems.

## Reach

- Cross-Team 

Your work consistently impacts multiple teams and informs decisions across the broader technology organization. You lead through influence and expertise, not just authority.

## Knowledge

- Demonstrate deep expertise in core technologies and architectural patterns used across the organization.
- Shape architectural decisions with a long-term, strategic mindset. Optimizes for scalability, maintainability, and business alignment.
- Draw on a strong foundation in engineering principles to navigate unfamiliar technologies with confidence. Adapt and apply core concepts to new domains, enabling effective problem-solving across varied tech stacks.
- Maintain a strong understanding of engineering workflows, standards, architectural decisions, and the broader system landscape to provide relevant context, promote alignment, and guide decision-making across teams.

## Communication

- Write and present proposals that influence technical direction across multiple teams.
- Facilitate architectural reviews and technical deep dives with empathy and clarity.
- Coach others in how to document, diagram, and communicate their own thinking effectively.
- Translate abstract or technical risk into understandable tradeoffs
- Drives conversations toward clarity by reducing complexity and identifying actionable next steps.

## Leadership

- Model engineering excellence and act as a multiplier: raising the bar for the entire engineering organization through mentorship, coaching, and influence.
- Facilitate learning across teams through initiatives such as architecture guilds, postmortems, or engineering summits.
- Own and improve engineering processes, standards, and tools that support a healthy, inclusive, and effective engineering culture.
